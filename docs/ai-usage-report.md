# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used & Use Cases
For this assignment, I used **ChatGPT (AI assistant)** to support my development of the personal portfolio web application.  
The main use cases included:
- **HTML/CSS guidance**: Creating and structuring the header, navigation bar, about section, projects section, and contact form.
- **Flexbox layouts**: Converting absolute/relative positioning into modern flexbox-based layouts for responsiveness across devices.
- **Styling enhancements**: Suggestions for hover effects, smooth scrolling between sections, circular profile image, spacing between elements, and transitions.
- **Debugging support**: Fixing issues such as hover effects not applying, images not showing due to incorrect paths, and alignment inconsistencies.
- **Accessibility & responsiveness**: Ensuring elements scale well for smaller screens (stacking layouts, fluid widths, responsive form design).

## Benefits & Challenges
**Benefits**
- Accelerated learning of responsive design concepts such as `flexbox`, `gap`, `object-fit`, and `scroll-behavior`.
- Step-by-step fixes for common issues (e.g., centering elements, hover effects, smooth scrolling).
- Creative enhancements like animated logos, smoother transitions, and profile photo styling.
- Exposure to best practices (cleaner layouts with flexbox, media queries for mobile, using `@font-face` responsibly).

**Challenges**
- Some AI suggestions required debugging (e.g., `box-shadow` syntax, hover behavior not working due to positioning).
- Managing multiple iterations: the AI proposed more advanced responsive patterns (hamburger menus, collapsing headers) which went beyond the current assignment scope, so I had to choose what was needed.
- Ensuring that suggestions matched the project’s file structure (image paths, font paths).

## Learning Outcomes
Through the use of AI assistance, I learned:
- How to properly apply **flexbox** for horizontal layouts and responsive stacking on smaller screens.
- How to use `@font-face` to integrate custom fonts and manage weights/styles.
- How to implement hover effects, transitions, and smooth scrolling for better UX.
- How to debug CSS and HTML issues step by step (e.g., checking DevTools for 404 errors when images didn’t load).
- The importance of semantic, responsive, and maintainable code rather than relying on fixed positioning.

## How I Modified AI Suggestions Responsibly
- I selectively applied AI suggestions:  
  - For example, when AI proposed absolute positioning, I replaced it with flexbox to maintain responsiveness.  
  - I simplified or removed advanced features (e.g., hamburger menus) that were unnecessary for this project.  
- I ensured code readability by cleaning up unused properties (like `top` and `left` offsets that were replaced by flexbox).  
- I verified every AI-generated snippet in my own project, tested across different screen sizes, and adjusted margins, spacing, and sizes manually where needed.  
- I kept creative control: I used AI ideas (like rotating logos and circular profile image) but styled them according to my own preferences.
